# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive analysis of a coffee shop's sales data, culminating in an interactive dashboard built in Tableau. The goal is to move beyond simple sales reporting and uncover actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency.

The final output is a live, interactive dashboard that allows for a deep dive into the coffee shop's performance.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary objective was to analyze transactional sales data to answer key business questions:

What are the overall sales trends on a weekly basis?

What are the busiest hours of the day, and how can we optimize staffing?

Which products and product categories are the top performers?

How do sales compare across different store locations?

üìà Key Insights & Recommendations
The analysis uncovered several key insights that can directly inform business strategy:

Operational Insight: Clear Morning Peak Hours

The "Total Sales by Hour of Day" analysis reveals a significant sales rush between 8 AM and 10 AM.

Recommendation: Management should ensure maximum staff coverage during these hours to handle high customer volume and minimize wait times. Marketing efforts for breakfast combos could also be targeted during this period.

Product Insight: Top Products Drive Revenue

A few key products, such as "Sustainably Grown Organic" and "Dark Chocolate Lg", are the top revenue drivers.

Recommendation: These "hero products" should be prominently featured in marketing materials and on menus. The business should also ensure these items are consistently in stock.

Category Insight: Coffee is King, but Bakery is a Strong Contributor

While Coffee makes up the largest portion of sales, the Bakery category is a significant contributor to revenue.

Recommendation: There is a strong opportunity for cross-selling and up-selling. Staff should be trained to suggest a pastry or biscotti with every coffee order to increase the average transaction value.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Tableau: For data cleaning, analysis, and creating the interactive dashboard.

CSV/Excel: As the source for the raw transactional data.
